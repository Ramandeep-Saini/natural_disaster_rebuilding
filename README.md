# natural_disaster_rebuilding
The objective of this project is to create an AI model that can input satellite images that include a before and after image of an area, and then classify the different levels of damage in that area based on a numerical scale to help assess damage and direct rebuilding efforts.
Our project is based on the xView2 challenge that took place in 2019, and we are using the datasets from https://xview2.org/dataset.
The baseline files from the challenge are available here, and they include files to organize the data, and a baseline model, among others: https://github.com/DIUx-xView/xView2_baseline/blob/master/README.md.
